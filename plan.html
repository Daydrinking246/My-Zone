  <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The goal of this website is ultimately to increase the amount of players/customers the business has. The website should both provide information and promote Diggers Beach Volleyball to a wider audience. While the website should ideally appeal to as many as possible, the website will be designed to be most appealing specifically to a younger audience. <br>
</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of this website will be determined on the increase in players at Diggers Beach Volleyball. If Diggers is found to have a large increase in players over a six month period, the site will be deemed a success. If over this six month period there is at least a 25% to 50% increase in players over this six month period, the site will be deemed a moderate success. If there is 51% to 100% increase in players over this period, the site will be considered a major success. If over this six month period there is an increase in players by less than 25%, the site will not be considered to be successful at achieving its goal. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>While this website should ideally be appealing to as many people as possible, the major target audience for this website will be the younger generation as requested by the business. The specific age range this website will be targeting will be from ages 15 to 30. The elder generation are stereotypically considered to be less ‘technically savvy’ and are likely to prefer a website that is simple and easy to use. As the younger generation are familiar with technology and how to use it they will likely care less about the simplicity of the website and care more about whether or not the website is attractive or not. This website will be designed with the priority of being aesthetically pleasing. The site will be aesthetically pleasinng by mostly sticking to one colour scheme and by having a relevant image on evey page. The colour scheme for the website will consist mostly of blue,white and yellow to match the Businesses’ logo. The image displayed for each page will be the ones provided by the business.</p>
